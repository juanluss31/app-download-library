# Introduction

Descargar libros de la biblioteca en streaming Ingebook.

Currently runs with:

- Angular v8.2.8
- Electron v6.0.10
- Electron Builder v21.2.0

With this sample, you can :

- Run your app in a local development environment with Electron & Hot reload
- Run your app in a production environment
- Package your app into an executable file for Linux, Windows & Mac

/!\ Angular 8.x CLI needs Node 10.9 or later to work.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository locally :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/juanluss31/app-download-library.git
```

Install dependencies with npm :

```bash
npm install
```

There is an issue with `yarn` and `node_modules` that are only used in electron on the backend when the application is built by the packager. Please use `npm` as dependencies manager.

If you want to generate Angular components with Angular-cli , you **MUST** install `@angular/cli` in npm global context.
Please follow [Angular-cli documentation](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) if you had installed a previous version of `angular-cli`.

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## To build for development

- **in a terminal window** -> npm start

Voila! You can use your Angular + Electron app in a local development environment with hot reload !

The application code is managed by `main.ts`. In this sample, the app runs with a simple Angular App (http://localhost:4200) and an Electron window.
The Angular component contains an example of Electron and NodeJS native lib import.
You can disable "Developer Tools" by commenting `win.webContents.openDevTools();` in `main.ts`.

| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run ng:serve:web`     | Execute the app in the browser                                                                              |
| `npm run build`            | Build the app. Your built files are in the /dist folder.                                                    |
| `npm run build:prod`       | Build the app with Angular aot. Your built files are in the /dist folder.                                   |
| `npm run electron:local`   | Builds your application and start electron                                                                  |
| `npm run electron:linux`   | Builds your application and creates an app consumable on linux system                                       |
| `npm run electron:windows` | On a Windows OS, builds your application and creates an app consumable in windows 32/64 bit systems         |
| `npm run electron:mac`     | On a MAC OS, builds your application and generates a `.app` file of your application that can be run on Mac |

**Your application is optimised. Only /dist folder and node dependencies are included in the executable.**

## You want to use a specific lib (like rxjs) in electron main thread ?

You can do this! Just by importing your library in npm dependencies (not devDependencies) with `npm install --save`. It will be loaded by electron during build phase and added to the final package. Then use your library by importing it in `main.ts` file. Easy no ?

## Browser mode

Maybe you want to execute the application in the browser with hot reload ? You can do it with `npm run ng:serve:web`.
**Note that you can't use Electron or NodeJS native libraries in this case.** Please check `providers/electron.service.ts` to watch how conditional import of electron/Native libraries is done.
